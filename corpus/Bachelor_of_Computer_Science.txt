The Bachelor of Computer Science (abbreviated BCompSc or BCS) is a bachelor's degree for completion of an undergraduate program in computer science. In general, computer science degree programs emphasize the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing.


== Typical requirements ==
Because computer science is a wide field, courses required to earn a bachelor of computer science degree vary. A typical list of course requirements includes topics such as:

Computer programming
Programming paradigms
Algorithms
Data structures
Logic & Computation
Computer architecture
Some schools may place more emphasis on mathematics and require additional courses such as:

Linear algebra
Calculus
Probability theory and statistics
Combinatorics and discrete mathematics
Differential calculus and mathematics
Beyond the basic set of computer science courses, students can typically choose additional courses from a variety of different fields, such as:

Theory of computation
Operating systems
Numerical computation
